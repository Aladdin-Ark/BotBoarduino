    Allows output of an RC signal based on the position of a 3-pin potentiometer (value).
    Two secondary 3-pin potentiometers are used to control the minimum and maximum range of pulsed width of the RC signal.
    The minimum can be set from 500-1450 us and the maximum can be set from 1550-2500 us.
    Typical RC signal is from 1000-2000 us (1500 us = center).
